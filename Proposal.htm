    <h1>Project Proposal- Michael Ruben</h1>

 <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
 <p>My Website will be about cars. I am very into cars and F1 racing, but 
     I will focus on mostly mid-range luxury cars such as; BMW, Mercedes-Benz,
     Porsche and Audi. I will compare and contrast competing models; as well as 
     give personal advice on personal preference and on other subjects that the audience would 
     like to know such as comfort and quality.
 </p>

<h3>What is the objective of your website?</h3>
<p>The objective of my website will be to attract audience that would like to know 
    recomendations as well as facts about mid-range luxury cars. I will also provide
    the audience with the latest images of the cars that way they can look at them. 
</p>
<h3>Who is your target audience set?</h3>
<p>My target audience will be people who are looking to know more about cars, as well 
    as people who are looking for reccomendations on cars. Car enthusiasts will be able to 
    look at each car's specs and information on the website. 
</p>

<h3>what content will you include in each page?(4)</h3>
<p>In my website I will plan on doing the first page about latest car and racing news,
    with some links to my other pages as well as attractive with original content. My 
    second page will include the cars I will talk about with it's respective specs and pictures
    so that people know what the cars have under the hood. My third Page will give my recomendations 
    on each of the cars that will be in the second page, allowing other people to comment and rate my 
    suggestions. My final page will have my personal information telling who i am and Why I like cars so much
